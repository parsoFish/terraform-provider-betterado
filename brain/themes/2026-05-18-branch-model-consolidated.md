# Branch model consolidated to a single `main`

At onboarding (2026-05-18) the repo shipped a deliberate **two-branch
model**: `main` tracked pristine upstream `microsoft/terraform-provider-
azuredevops`, and a `betterado` branch held *all* fork work, synced via
`git merge upstream/main` → `betterado`. The repo's own `CLAUDE.md` still
documents this.

Forge's project model is single-branch (one working tree per project; the
cycle operates on `main` + per-initiative branches). So onboarding
consolidated: `main` was a strict ancestor of `betterado` (0 ahead, 4
behind), so `main` was **fast-forwarded** onto `betterado`'s tip — no merge
commit, no history rewrite, zero data loss — then pushed, and `betterado`
deleted local + remote. `main` now IS the fork at `0822657`.

**Consequence for planners/architects:** the `CLAUDE.md` "Fork Workflow"
section (main = upstream, betterado = work, `upstream` remote merges) is
**stale and must not be trusted**. Upstream syncs, if ever wanted, now need
a different mechanism — an `upstream` remote merged directly into `main`,
which will hit the known ~450-file `microsoft/`→`parsoFish/` rename + the
`betterado_` prefix conflicts. Treat upstream-sync as out of scope unless
an initiative explicitly asks for it.
